# Insurance Data Analytics Project - HBA

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the financial performance of insurance policies for HBA, with a focus on identifying factors contributing to **premium losses**, evaluating the relationship between **sum assured** and **premiums charged**, and analyzing product-level "imbalances". The analysis was performed using SQL, Python, and PowerBI, leveraging AI-driven tools like PowerBIâ€™s Decomposition Tree for diagnostic insights.

## Key Metrics

- **Total Sum Assured**: RM 1.57 billion
- **Total Premiums Charged**: RM 41.74 million
- **Loss Ratio**: 2.78%
- **Client Lifetime Value**: RM 143,000
- **Number of Policies **: 4,017
- **Number of Clients **: 3,874

## Objectives

1. **Premium Loss Analysis**: Identify key variables contributing to premium losses using diagnostic tools.
2. **Product Imbalance Analysis**: Evaluate the disparities between **sum assured** and **premiums paid** across product types.
3. **Recommendations for Rebalancing**: Propose strategies to rebalance the product offerings and improve financial performance.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**: For data storage and querying, enabling complex joins and data slicing.
- **Python**: For data cleansing, manipulation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **PowerBI**: To create interactive dashboards and leverage AI-driven decomposition trees for diagnostic analysis.

## Diagnostic Analysis Findings

Through the use of PowerBI's Decomposition Tree, the following key factors were found to contribute to **high premium losses**:

1. **Payment Mode 12**: Contributed RM 1,008,408 in losses (annual premium payments)
2. **Insurance Product E**: Contributed RM 821,280 in losses
3. **Marital Status (Married)**: Contributed RM 560,472
4. **Gender (Male)**: Contributed RM 304,944
5. **Income Band Q1 (Lowest quartile)**: Contributed RM 166,392
6. **Location (Selangor)**: Contributed RM 83,784

Slicing and dicing further to analyse key factors for **high premium losses** for Product A:

1. **Payment Mode 12**: Contributed RM 186,768 in losses (annual premium payments)
2. **Gender (Female)**: Contributed RM 128,808
3. **Income Band Q2 (Second Lower quartile)**: Contributed RM 80,224
4. **Age Group (B) **: Contributed RM 49,476
5. **Marital Status (Single)**: Contributed RM 49,476
6. **Location (Selangor)**: Contributed RM 30,265

Slicing and dicing further to analyse key factors for **high premium losses** for Product E:

1. **Payment Mode 12**: Contributed RM 821,280 in losses (annual premium payments)
2. **Marital Status (Married)**: Contributed RM 560,472
3. **Gender (Male)**: Contributed RM 304,944
4. **Income Band Q1 (Lowest quartile)**: Contributed RM 166,392
5. **Location (Selangor)**: Contributed RM 83,784
6. **Age Group (B)**: Contributed RM 30,816

## Analytical Process

1. **Data Segmentation**: Policies were segmented by product type.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Median sum assured and average premiums were calculated for each product group.
3. **Imbalance Detection**: Disparities between individual policies and product-level metrics were identified.
4. **AI-Driven Insights**: PowerBI's Decomposition Tree was used to uncover key contributors to premium losses.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights the importance of adjusting premium structures, product features, and pricing strategies to align better with policyholder demographics and payment modes. Recommendations include:

- Adjust pricing strategies for Product E and Product A to reduce premium losses.
- Offer more flexible payment modes to reduce the impact of annual payment defaults.
- Tailor policies and communication for specific demographic groups to improve retention.

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Insurance-Data-Analytics-HBA.git
   
## Structuring workflow for the analysis

*Tools used*:  Python (Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy), MSSQL, PowerBI

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation in Python
- **Extract Data**: Load the **Customer** and **Account** datasets from raw data into Python first
- **Clean Data**: Handle missing values and normalize data types (e.g., dates, numerical fields) in Python

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
- **Analyze Distributions**: Perform basic EDA to understand the distributions of key variables (e.g., `SUM_ASSURED`, `MODAL_PREMIUM`).
- **Detect Outliers**: Identify and flag outliers , inconsistencies in the data & handle missing values.

### 3. Data Loading to the database
- **Create Database and Tables**: Set up the database and create the necessary tables for `Account` and `Customer` data in SQL.
- **Load Data**: Use `BULK INSERT` or similar SQL commands to populate the tables with data from CSV files.
- **Basic Table Structure**: The table prepared for 'Account' and 'Customer' are prepared with specific fields

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in SQL
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate key aggregate statistics (sum, average, median) for key metrics such as sum assured and premiums.
- **Grouping by Policy Type and Status**: Explores how each different policies and statuses contributed to the premiums.
- **Portfolio Distribution: Determine the percentage of policies in idfferent statuses,further helping to define the portfolio distribution.

### 5. Key Metrics Calculations in SQL
- **Premiums Paid vs Sum Assured: Compares the sum assured to the median for each product type and the premiums paid to the average for each product type, which helps to identify the imbalances where the premiums do not reflect the coverage offered
- **Client distribution based on premiums and coverage: Calculate the number of clients that fall above or below the average premium and median sum assured, which also helps to classify which clients are over or underpaying

### 6. Diagnostic Analytics in SQL
- **Demographics: Explore how demographics (age, gender, marital status) affect policy subscriptions, premiums payment and surrender rates
- **Policy Surrenders: Investigate policies that have been surrendered, including which demographics groups or policy types, providing insights into the potential reasons of premium losses

### 7. Insights and Recommendations
- **Underpriced policies: Highlight policies where clients pay below average premiums for above-average sum assured, suggesting there could be underpricing policies
- **Policy Optimization: Re-adjust or re-evaluate the product offerings (type E, A, C & D), ensuring profitability to the company
